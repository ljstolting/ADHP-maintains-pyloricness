This folder contains the set of circuit evolutions that were performed including timing awards on top of the
ordering criteria:

1.  All neurons silent before LPstart
2.	PYstart < LPend
3.	LPend < PYend

To calculate timing awards, utilized statistics published by Prinz et al. (2004) in 'Similar network activiy 
from disparate circuit parameters' (Table 1), expressed as a fraction of the total period:
PD duty cycle: mean = .385, s.d. = .040
LP duty cycle: mean = .264, s.d. = .059
PY duty cycle: mean = .348, s.d. = .054
LP start phase (offset from PDstart): mean = .533, s.d. = .054
PY start phase (offset from PDstart): mean = .758, s.d. = .060
Each of these five features were calculated for a candidate rhythm, then the z-score was calculated as if it came
from the experimentally observed distribution. The z-scores were averaged, inverted and added to fitness. 


Only the following sub-ordering type was represented among evolved circuits:

- 0. 2. 1. 4. 3. 5.

(where LPstart=0, LPend=1, PYstart=2, PYend=3, PDstart=4, PDend=5)
